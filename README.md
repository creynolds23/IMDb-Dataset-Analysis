# Overview
As a computer engineer eager to enhance my data analysis skills, I embarked on a project to analyze a dataset. I strived to provide meaningful insights into the data, showing my analytical and coding abilities.

The dataset I worked on is IMDb Movie Data that has data for movies from 2006 - 2016. It contains information about various movies such as titles, directors, ratings, revenues, and more.

My primary goal in developing this software was to perform data analysis on the IMDb Movie Data. I wanted to answer different questions about the dataset, such as finding trends in movie ratings and revenues over the years, and classifying mvoies into rating categories. This software allows me to perform these analyses.

# Data Analysis Results
1. Trends in Votes and Revenue: Found trends in movie votes and revenues over the years. The software helps visualize and analyze the data to identify this pattern.
2. Top Movies: Determined the top 10 movies with the longest runtimes, highest ratings, and highest revenues. These results also have visuals.
3. Genre Analysis: Analyzed movie genres, counting occurrences of each unique genre.
4. Rating Classification: Create a new column to classify movies into various categories based on their ratings.

# Development Environment
This software was created using the following tools and technologies:
* Programming Language: Python
* Jupyter Notebook ran in Visual Studio Code with Anaconda
* Libraries: pandas, seaborn, collections, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization

# Future Work
1. I plan on gathering more up to date date to represent in my analysis.
2. I can implement more questions to the data to analyze and find trends to.
3. Create better visualizations to improve the quality and variety making the results more engaging and informative.
